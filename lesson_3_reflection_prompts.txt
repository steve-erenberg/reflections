When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  
  When you were collaborating with other people

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	So that you don't accidentally ovewrite code that you have written on
your local repository


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Forks make a copy of a repository on GitHub. Clones make copies on a
local computer or between GitHub & a local computer. Branches are for adding
commits to a repository without disturbing the main branch
