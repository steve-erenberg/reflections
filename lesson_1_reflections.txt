How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
	
	By seeing what changed from one version of the file to the next


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

	By not having to rewrite code if you change your code & it stops working. By understanding where bugs are introduced after they manifest.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

	It allows you to commit changes at a point that is logical in terms of describing what the change does so that others can understand the diff better (and you can too when going back to it)


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

	Because Git is meant for programming projects where there are usually multiple files required to make a change

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

	You use git log to find the commit that you are interested in based on the commit comment. Then you use git diff to show what changed in each impacted file from one commit to the next.


Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

	Source control
